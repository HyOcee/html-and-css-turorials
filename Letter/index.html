        <strong>Dear Divine,</strong>

        <section align='justify'>
            <center><h3>FITNESS FOR INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME</h3></center>
            <p>
                I hope you are doing well. It's been a pleasure meeting you and I look forward to working with you.
                <br><br>                
                I am <strong>Emuemhonjie Osemegbe, </strong> a newly recruited intern in the FRONTEND department at 
                <abbr title="Software Business Solutions Consulting"><strong>SBSC</strong></abbr>. I'm really excited to be 
                here and I appreciate the opportunity to start an Internship at this early stage of my career as 
                a web developer. I started learning <em>frontend</em> development in August, 2021
                when I finished my final exams as an undergraduate. I studied Mechanical Engineering and it might
                seem anomalous that I am a web developer now but, I have always had a passion to know 
                how things work and this due to this <em>curiosity</em>, I stumbled on frontend and 
                <em>fell in love</em>. Asides the <b><mark>frontend trifecta (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)</mark></b>. 
                I have some exposure to <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b> programming languages.
                <br><br>
                My Engineering background has helped me develop quick thinking, critical thinking and
                    problem solving skills and also the ability to comprehend complex concepts. In other words, 
                    I am very smart and I learn very fast. I also have the abilities to work as part of a team and
                    relate with colleagues and superiors professionally. As much as I hate being wrong, 
                    I love taking corrections 
                    as they help me develop and grow faster. <br><br>
                I'm writing this letter on the third day and despite my months of 
                <strong><em>self-learning</em></strong>, I still find myself learning new things in 
                <strong>HTML</strong> which I find amazing. <samp><em>Shout out to our facilitator,
                <strong>FISAYO.</strong></em></samp>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <i>
                    I know there's a lot more to learn and I intend to put in my best to gather as much knowledge 
                as possible during the course of this programme, <del>do my best</del> put in the best effort
                    in all assignments and projects and I can assure you that the investment of the Company in me
                    would not go down the drain.
